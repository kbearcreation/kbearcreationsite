    <h3>Art</h3>
    <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>

    <p>I have created art througout my life, but only recently have I turned my sights on doing it professionally. I am, at heart, a storyteller and there are so many way to tell stories that I can't limit myself to any one medium. Recently I have returned to woodworking and scultpture, inspired by the work that I grew up watching my father <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jim.baringer.7" target="_blank">Jim Baringer</a> do in his shop. I've found that wood has a quality that imbues any sculpture with a deeper meaning than just the shapes carved out by the artist. It has the history of a lifetime told in it's grain that cannot be manufactured, but it can be explored during the sculpting process and incorporated into the story that a piece tells. </p>

    <p>In addition to woodworking and sculpture I am involved in creating drawings and illustrations, both by hand and digitally, for fantastical and wonderous stories brought to life by tabletop roleplaying games like <a href="https://tumbledie.com/trove" target="_blank">Trove</a>, the game created by me and my partners at <a href="https://tumbledie.com" target="_blank">Tumbledie Games</a>. I've had lots of fun designing the cover of the <a href="https://tumblediegames.itch.io/trove" target="_blank">Trove Foundation rulebook</a> and other pieces for the game and look forward to growing my portfolio of work to ignite the imagination.</p>

    <h3>Professional Videography</h3>
    <i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i>

    <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then imagine how much can be conveyed by 24 images per second?  Video is a medium which captures our attention and brings forth emotions like no other, but only when used correctly.</p>

    <p>I work closely with my clients to determine how to best tell their stories through motion pictures, whether for their wedding day, interviews or commercials. I use professional recording equipment and techniques to capture audio and video and edit the raw materials to create a final product that stands out and brings forth the emotional connection that only video can.</p>

    <h3>Expert Web Development</h3>
    <i class="fa fa-drupal"></i>

    <p>Websites are more than just the modern equivelent of the shingle we hang up when we are open for business.  They are a chance to connect with an audience using words, pictures, videos and sound to share ideas and feelings as well as information.  They are also a platform for that audience to connect back, creating conversations, collaborations and communities.</p>

    <p>Bringing over 20 years of software engineering experience to the table, I work together with my clients to understand their needs and navigate the vast assortment of solutions available to find what suits them best.  I specialize in open-source technologies using the Drupal application platform and front-end resources such as Bootstrap and various Javascript libraries and frameworks.  Knowing how to leverage the wealth of resources in those open-source communities is just as valuable as being able to write code from scratch, and I love doing both.</p>

    <h3>Testimonials</h3>
    <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

    <p><em>"Kevin understood exactly what we hoped for in a wedding video, and he captured our incredible day perfectly! The video told the story of the day with beautiful imagery of all the important moments - even many we had no idea were going to happen. Kevin listened to our ideas and found ways to feature our friends, family, music, and rustic setting -- and his editing blended it all together seamlessly with perfect music choices, natural sound, and gorgeous visuals. From start to finish, procession to cake, he incorporated everything we had hoped and much more that made for wonderful surprises in the final result. We can't wait to share this video with our guests and those who could not be there, and will enjoy watching it ourselves to relive this once-in-a-lifetime day."</em>
